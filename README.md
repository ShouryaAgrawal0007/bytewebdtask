# BYTE WEBD task journey 
I am Avni Goel, pursuing Btech in the CST branch.
I am a beginner in the field of learning technologies...but with a set goal in my mindset, I decided to choose to work on the website development task.
I already knew the basic HTML before beginning. But only HTML was not enough to build this project. So I have completed learning CSS and Javascript from scratch within the given allotted time span for the task. I even learn API calling and AXIOS.
I made the task using the css properties and flexbox concept. 
I further started learning REACT but got errors while installing the necessary REACT package, maybe the terminal version was at fault. My terminal is currently on 'bash' version...so i tried updating it to 'zsh' but the system showed some unwilling errors. And hence the further issues could not get recognizable by the terminal og react installing commands. Now, I am under the process of rectifying the same.

Although I could not complete the task 100% but definitely tried to accomplish it. But nevertheless, I made two interesting projects using HTML, CSS and JS which can be viewed in the shared Google Drive Link.
I request you to kindly consider them as well.
